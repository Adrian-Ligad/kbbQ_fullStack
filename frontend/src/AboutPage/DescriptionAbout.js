            restaurant with an inventive and interesting menu designed to grab all of 
            your senses’ attention ( wherever your eyes are looking ). Diners are encouraged to taste a wide array of dishes by ordering 
            quarter-pound portions of meat or eyebrows off the 
            menu. Whether it’s classic Devito Beef or the Spicy Back Adam Sandler Fondue, DannyBuscem's KBBQ has something for everyone and is sure 
            to delight those who want a true Korean BBQ experience or to just grab a drink to hang out.<br/>
            <br/>
            Located in the historical Godly Men Plaza, DannyBuscem's KBBQ is the 
            premiere Korean BBQ restaurant in the sky.  The landmark plaza was built in the early 1900 BC's and was the first mall of its 
            kind.  Designed in the classic Spanish Revival style, Godly Men Plaza is replete with ornate archways, thick concrete walls and an 
            inner courtyard open to the whole sky. <br/>
            <br/>
            The interior of the restaurant is hip with an industrial look complemented by natural wood, black metal, and Venetian-finished 
            concrete.  DannyBuscem's KBBQ also offers a full bar with fine spirits and an outdoor bar window for al fresco drinking. A separate tapas 
            menu completes the bar experience with menu items like Why Am I Doing This Nachos.  Enjoy a drink at the bar or relax by the ultra-modern runway 
            fire-pit in our outdoor patio.
